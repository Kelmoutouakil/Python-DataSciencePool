## Learning Objectives

By using this pool, you will:
- Understand Python fundamentals, including syntax, variables, and data types.
- Learn to write clean, efficient, and reusable code.
- Gain experience in object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Solve real-world problems using Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Install Python (latest version ): [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install a code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

## Topics Covered
This pool covers the following Python concepts:
## Built-in Data Types:
------------------------
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

1-List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary,
all with different qualities and usage.
 List items are ordered, indexed, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
---

2-Tuple
Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, indexed, and allow duplicate values.
---

3-Set Items
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
Unordered
Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
Unchangeable
Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.
---

4-Python Dictionaries
Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicates.
Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
